Recently, I've started listening to _[Think and Grow Rich][hill]_ by Napoleon Hill. It's a classic business novel aimed at grooming current and would-be entrepreneurs to be fantastically successful. Recent books I've read in the same vein include _[Rich Dad, Poor Dad][rdpd]_, _[The Cashflow Quadrant][cfq]_, _[Rich Dad's Guide to Investing][rdgti]_ (all of which are authored by Robert Kiyosaki), and _[The 4-Hour Workweek][ferris]_ by Timothy Ferris.

I feel like I've been continually brought towards an ever nearing event or events in my life by reading these books. Each one has changed the way I think, often in large ways, and has allowed me to once again take a personal inventory of who I am, and what I feel like my purpose is.

Thus far in Hill's book, he has talked about the power of "the secret". After talking to Dustin, who has read _Think and Grow Rich_ numerous times, I realized that the "creators" of the cult hit movie/book combo _The Secret_ have borrowed many of the same ideas that Hill points out in the book. Anyways, this secret that Hill keeps alluding to (he doesn't say exactly what it is) is a power that has propelled many men (and women) throughout history to achieve great things and accumulate large sums of wealth. 
Thus far, I have taken the definition of "the secret" to be **unrivaled determination**. I am so excited to continue to grow and learn through reading the success stories and habits of those who have been successful before. 
In the end, I am determined to grow and progress as a human being. I am determined to write my own history (not literally, at least not yet) by making choices and decisions that improve who I am. There is definitely going to be more to follow on this, but I'm writing this several hours after I read the book and apparently am not that fantastic at writing... yet.

Small, measurable, achievable goals is the name of the game. Oh yeah, and solid determination to achieve them.
