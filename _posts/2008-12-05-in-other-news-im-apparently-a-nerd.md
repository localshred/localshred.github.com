So I found this new java app the other day from [wordle.net](http://www.wordle.net "Wordle.net"). It allows you to enter a block of text, a blog url, or a del.icio.us username to get a large body of text content. Using some really great algorithms they build a word cloud based on the frequency of words in the document. I ran the generator on [my del.icio.us tags](http://del.icio.us/localshred "My del.icio.us tags") and generated the document you see on the left.

As I showed it to my brother-in-law he blurted out, "Man! You're a nerd!" Ouch. Indeed it hurt for just a moment, a small fleeting moment. Then I got over it.

I also created a wordle from the content of this site a few days ago, that one is below. You should [try it out](http://www.wordle.net/create "Create your own wordle!"), it's really really cool!
