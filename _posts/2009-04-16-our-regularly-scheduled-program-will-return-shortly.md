Just passing word along that I'm on a brief post-writing hiatus due to a big project at work we're trying to close out. No, that doesn't mean I write my posts while at work (at least, not _all_ of them), but means that I'm so burned out by the end of the night from having worked 10 or 12 hours that I have no desire to use the computer at all.

Our regularly scheduled program will return shortly, but in the meantime, have a cocktail and enjoy this random video I just dug up for you... _going to youtube to find something random_
