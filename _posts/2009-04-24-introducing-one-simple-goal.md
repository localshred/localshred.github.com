In my recent post [In a rut and tired of it]({% post_url 2009-04-21-in-a-rut-and-tired-of-it %} "Previous Post: In a rut and tired of it"), I mentioned a possible solution to some nagging issues that continue to be difficult for me to overcome. May I quote:

> So, here's what I'm going to do. Set _One_ simple goal each night before going to bed, to be completed the following day. The goal can range anywhere from spiritual to entrepreneurial. Simplicity will be favored over complexity, but I won't be shying away from possible complex issues. **The point is to do _SOMETHING_**. It is my desire that each day I will produce a favorable gain in removing some obstacle that has stood in my way recently.

That was four days ago, and I have already been getting amazing results out of accomplishing a simple daily goal. My first four goals were: Tuesday) wake up at 8 am; Wednesday) Begin building a website to track goals, pushing it to the server; Thursday) Finalize the beta features of the website and start getting feedback from people; Friday) Contact a friend I've lost contact with. I have accomplished all four goals. The first and last goals were fairly simple, though still required determination to complete. The middle two goals were much more complex and time-sensitive, requiring even more determination and willpower to complete within one day. It was a good test to see how simplicity vs. complexity affects the decisions you make while accomplishing the goal.

By setting the goal to work hard on the website to get it out, I incentivized myself to put away distractions (like email, facebook, twitter) and focus more. I continually was assessing the amount of time I had to accomplish the goal, making value judgements based on the end goal I was desiring. Several times last night I had to abandon the feature I wanted to build because it was taking too long. This was a fabulous way to learn about the power of constraints that Jason Fried was [talking about]({% post_url 2009-04-21-gellin-for-great-experience %} "Jason Fried discussing the use of constraints to get things done.").

**[OneSimpleGoal.com](http://www.onesimplegoal.com "OneSimpleGoal.com")**

The purpose of [OneSimpleGoal.com](http://www.onesimplegoal.com "OneSimpleGoal.com") is to provide _you_ with an opportunity to simply set and complete daily goals. There are (and will be) very few bells and whistles to the app, I want the simplicity of the concept to shine through. As such, there isn't much color, imagery, or content. All things are focused on you setting a goal for that day (or the next), and then empowering you to get it done. Upcoming revisions to the site will address some of your initial ideas about how to improve the site. I am so excited to have this app out early and having people using it, even in an infantile or beta state.

You can get daily updates on the status of development on the app through [twitter.com/onesimplegoal](http://www.twitter.com/onesimplegoal "@onesimplegoal on Twitter") and the [One Simple Goal group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=82129429046 "One Simple Goal group on facebook") on facebook. If you have any ideas, concerns, bug reports, testimonials, or any other feedback about the app, please let me know by commenting on this post, replying @onesimplegoal on twitter, posting to the wall on the facebook group, or emailing me at bj [dot] neilsen [at] gmail [dot] com.

Now go out and start changing your life by accomplishing your simple daily goals!
