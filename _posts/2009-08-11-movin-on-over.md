As you probably can tell, I've gone quiet on the blogging front for a while. It's not you, it's me. I've been lacking creatively for quite a while, being energetically drained by numerous sources that you don't really need to worry yourselves over. Needless to say, I'm back into blogging form, or am attempting it yet again.

I'll likely be transitioning over to my new blog [rand9.com](http://www.rand9.com "rand9.com"). I had initially intended to only post tech-specific things on that blog, and keep more personal matters over here, but this post changed my mind. I want to focus my energy on one blog, and I feel like the rand9 name is what I want to put my energy into.

Fear not, I will continue to strive to put more content than just tech stuff over there, so you will still get the usual banter and rantings. I still plan on posting a lot about entrepreneurialism and projects that I'm engaged in. So head on over to the [new blog](http://www.rand9.com) and give the few articles a read. Oh, and if you've subscribed to this blog's RSS feed, be sure to do so [over there](http://feeds.feedburner.com/rand9) as well. Thanks for all the feedback over this last year on these posts!
