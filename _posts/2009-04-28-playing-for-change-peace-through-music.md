Dustin sent this along today, and I have to say it is one of the coolest music projects I have ever heard of. The producers travel around the world recording tracks with various musicians, then mix it all into a great video/musical journey. SO COOL. The project/documentary can be found at [playingforchange.com](http://playingforchange.com/ "Playing for Change: Peace through music.") where their tagline is "Peace through music". Apparently you can buy their songs on iTunes as well. Absolutely fantastic idea.
