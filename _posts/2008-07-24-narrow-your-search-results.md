In light of the current thoughts and inspirations that I have been experiencing, I thought I'd record this epiphany that I have had in the last few days with regards to achieving goals. Like many people I know, every so often I get the gumption to set a bazillion goals to improve my life. I've had lists with 10 things, and lists with 110 things, yet each time I've created a goals list I am on fire for a short time, and then subconsciously decide not to do them.

I generally bail on a set of goals because of the scope those goals entail. I'm often setting goals for things like hygiene, eating/sleeping habits, work ethics, etc. What's more, many (or all) goals that have been set and abandoned are truly worthwhile things that I'd like to achieve... which is all the more frustrating. So here we go again. Only this time, I plan on succeeding.

This time my M.O. is to focus entirely on one goal at a time, overshadowed by a much larger goal that I could work on for the remainder of my life. A singular focus. By focusing on a single goal, I will have the ability to devote all my time and energy into incrementally achieving it, and getting incrementally closer to the "pie in the sky".

A few weeks ago in church I had a similar stroke of inspiration and took some quick notes... so here it is.

The next few posts will likely start boiling down to "whadda you want, whadda you want, whadda you want, whadda you want, whadda you want, whadda you want" so that I can decide what it is that I want to focus on. This is where the fun begins.
