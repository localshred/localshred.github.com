I thought I'd give a rundown on some various statistics about our family since we've been one.

- **4.5** - the number of years we've been married.
- **2** - the number of kids we have.
- **6** - the number of jobs I've had: [The Quarry](http://www.quarryclimbing.com/ "The Quarry Indoor Climbing Center"), [Primerica](http://www.primerica.com/ "Primerica, Inc."), [Wildcat Software](http://www.wildcatsoftware.net "Wildcat Software, Inc."), [Heritage Web Solutions](http://www.heritagewebdesign.com/ "Heritage Web Solutions"), MarketPartner, [BidSync](http://www.bidsync.com "BidSync").
- **480%** - the amount of annual pay increase I've received since we've been married (which is more staggering because of the low end than the high).
- **41,674** - the number of plausible business ideas I've had (and not implemented).
- **Infinity** - the number of years more we have to be together (and that's a good thing :)).
