My friend Ryan of [RyanByrd.net](http://www.ryanbyrd.net/rambleon "RyanByrd.net") fame (touted as "[probably the coolest site in utah](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=coolest+site+in+utah&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 "google search for 'probably the coolest site in utah'")") posted an article this morning per my recommendation about today being [Day of the Ninja](http://dayoftheninja.com/index2.html "Day of the Ninja") . He kindly added a link back to my tech site [rand9.com](http://www.rand9.com "rand9 Technologies") for the tip, unwittingly catapulting me into website-release-mode. You see, though I have owned rand9.com since April-ish and have had plans to do many noteworthy things with it, I have yet to be "on the ball" about it.

Don't get me wrong, I've been building it slowly and steadily since buying the domain, I just... haven't gotten around to finishing it. Okay, you got me. I haven't touched the thing for at least 3 months. Nevertheless, my intentions remain. For now, the masses will have to ogle at my ability to put a "Coming Soon"\* site up in under 30 minutes. I hope you enjoy.

And I promise that I will do better to follow through on my posting, both here and at rand9.
