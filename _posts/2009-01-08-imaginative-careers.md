Driving to work this morning I saw the above image displayed prominently on the back of the van ahead of me. The image is blurry, so I'll translate:

> **_Satellite TV Installers_**

Apparently, imagination solves all problems, including the fact that your career might be a dead end and boring as all-get-out. If the above is true, I wonder what it is that Satellite TV Installers _do_ think about while at work to increase their job satisfaction. I suppose I may never know.
