I just came across this amazing video of how soccer unites people around the world. It's a bit long, but it has absolutely been the highlight of my day.

[The Soccer Project](http://vimeo.com/3885949) from [Rebekah Fergusson](http://vimeo.com/user1462859) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Did it make me shed a tear? Maybe.

**UPDATE:** I got Pelada (the name of the documentary) for Christmas in 2010 and it is EXCELLENT. Go buy it today.
