<div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;ve patiently awaited results (don&#8217;t deny it) from my <a href="/blog/learning_how_to_focus" title="Learning how to focus">previous post</a>, and indeed I&#8217;ve been planning on it. Sometimes plans don&#8217;t work out how we expect them to. And sometimes they do. Here is part 2 of <a href="/blog/learning_how_to_focus" title="Learning how to focus"><strong>Learning how to focus</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Approximately 6 weeks ago I <a href="/blog/learning_how_to_focus" title="Learning how to focus">deleted my Twitter and Facebook accounts</a>. It was an impulsive move. An idea came to me, I talked to my wife about it, we agreed, and I just did it. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of drama involved, I had just gotten to the point where I felt I was losing valuable time using those services. I&#8217;m not going to go into more of the &#8220;why&#8221; details, I already <a href="/blog/learning_how_to_focus" title="Learning how to focus">did that</a>.</p>

<h2>The positive stuff</h2>

<p>Since purging the web-social scene from my daily life, I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of positive gains. For one, I&#8217;m a <em>lot</em> more focused while at work. We&#8217;re talking orders-of-magnitude more focused. Before it was easy to spend a lot of time posting stuff on Twitter or reading people&#8217;s Facebook updates. Now, those distractions are not just archived, they&#8217;re completely gone.</p>

<p>Since &#8220;the purge&#8221; I&#8217;ve hit all my project deadlines at work, something that is actually fairly difficult for a developer to do in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_development" title="Waterfall Development Model">serial environment</a>. Well, I hate sweeping generalizations; <strong><em>I</em></strong> have a hard time hitting deadlines in a serial environment, though I&#8217;m not alone, just go read some <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles.html#id22657" title="Fowler Articles on Agile Programming">Fowler</a> essays on Agile Programming.</p>

<p>Speaking of Fowler, I&#8217;ve totally come to love the essays he writes about <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html" title="Fowler: Is Design Dead?">software design</a>, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles.html#id22657" title="Fowler Articles on Agile Programming">agile programming</a>, test-driven development, etc. He&#8217;s just a genius, and a great writer. If you write code, you should read Fowler. I never would have had time to read any of his stuff had it not been for &#8220;the purge&#8221;. As a side note, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.marco.org/about" title="Marco Arment">Marco&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://instapaper.com" title="Instapaper iPhone App">Instapaper</a> iPhone app on any article I&#8217;d like to read, but want to &#8220;read later&#8221;. It&#8217;s my number one app. Go <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288545208&amp;mt=8" title="Instapaper on the App Store">buy it</a>.</p>

<p>One facet of the purge was removing a lot of RSS feeds from my daily intake. I kept around 40 or so, though most have a post frequency of less than 1 per week, so I rarely have more than 3 or 4 articles at a time in reader. This is really nice because I still can get some info I want, but my take has been that it&#8217;s completely non-pressuring me. I don&#8217;t feel the desire to constantly check, because I know that there probably isn&#8217;t anything there. There are stretches of days where I don&#8217;t even check it because it&#8217;s completely off my mind. This is <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing I was going for.</p>

<h2>The weird stuff</h2>

<p>There have definitely been some weird side-effects to the purge. For example, when I read an interesting blog post or listen to a cool song, or whatever, I <em>still</em> (to this day) think about posting it to Twitter/Facebook. I mean, that&#8217;s how addicted I was. It&#8217;s kind of like my withdrawal cravings I guess. Still, very weird.</p>

<p>Something else weird happened: I turned into an old man. Over the past few weeks, my average bed time has gotten earlier than before. I&#8217;m now going to bed between 10 and 11, sometimes even earlier. Just a few days ago I literally fell asleep at 8:30 pm. I&#8217;m crazy like that.</p>

<h2>The &#8220;huh?&#8221; stuff</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that I haven&#8217;t posted a ding-dang thing since I wrote about the purge. Along with the purge came a huge case of writers block. I mean, we&#8217;re talking mammoth. I have had a continual desire to <em>want</em> to blog and write stuff that is random and annoying, but I just haven&#8217;t gotten to the point of writing it. It&#8217;s really weird, possibly coincidental to the time period. If you followed this blog before when it was on wordpress, you&#8217;ll know that I had gotten less frequent in those postings too, so maybe it&#8217;s a deeper issue. I do love how Marco talks about <a href="http://www.marco.org/93193436" title="marco.org: Avoiding the Blogger trap">not caring</a> about the frequency of posts on his blog, that he blogs <a href="http://articles.marco.org/261" title="marco.org: Do your own thing">whatever and whenever</a> he wants to. This is totally the style of blog I want to cultivate. I&#8217;ve just not really had the drive to post at all lately. And it&#8217;s bugging me.</p>

<p>Sure, this post is a new post on the blog. So I guess it&#8217;s good that I&#8217;m getting some of it out there. I just want a bit more consistency. Not like, &#8220;I must blog every 2 days&#8221; or something stupid, just&#8230; you know, semi-regular updates. When I get an idea about a post, I want to just write it and post it. So that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m working on.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest frustration that I&#8217;ve hit is the lack of motivation to work on my entrepreneurial pursuits. I have literally done nothing towards furthering my goal of being an independent business owner. Usually I reserved evenings or saturday&#8217;s for times when I could push forward on my ideas, and I&#8217;ve just completely fallen out of that routine. This is probably the biggest head-scratcher of the whole purge process. It was when I was &#8220;addicted&#8221; to the consumption of information that I was passionate about working on my ideas. Now that the addiction is gone&#8230; so is the passion. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced the two are related, so I&#8217;m still working through a lot of that in my head. Crap&#8230; that makes me sound like a manic-depressive psychopath. Just know that I&#8217;m not. I promise.</p>

<p><strong>What are some gains or shortfalls you&#8217;ve seen in me since the purge? What about yourself?</strong></p>
