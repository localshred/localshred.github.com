I am currently tied to a ubiquitous 9-5 software job. There are things that I like and some things I would change if given the opportunity. Given everything, I'm happy to have a paycheck and get to learn some new stuff. Good. Great. All that being said, I wouldn't be sad if a company came out of nowhere and offered a substantial pay raise and/or promised me the ability to fight off aliens with my custom regular expression engine. Translation: I wouldn't be sad to leave if the right offer came along.

However...

What happens when said "sweep me off my feet" potential company calls my _work phone_ to discuss possible employment opportunities? Such was the case for me this afternoon. I received an instant message from a girl in our tech support department saying that I had a Lawrence Jamison (do I know this guy?) on the line to speak to me. I was surprised at this since I've been at this company over 3 months and have not received (nor have needed to receive) any phone calls. I write code. Talk to someone else about the project details. I told the gal to send them to voicemail because I was "in the middle of a project" and "didn't have time". 
A few minutes later the voicemail comes through. Lawrence is apparently no one I know at all. He's some guy I've never met wanting to "talk to me about some things". He could be a member of the mob for all I know. Apparently he "found me on [linked in](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bjneilsen "My profile on Linked In")". So, I go to linked in and do a search for his name. There's two results to the search, but one of the results has a shared connection to me, so I'm assuming that's the guy. The best I can figure, he is a recruiter for a company looking to hire a Java developer. I've been investigating and it looks like a fairly viable opportunity, but I am wondering what in the world he was thinking by calling me _at work_. Isn't that what linked in is for? Getting in contact with professionals in a professional way?

Maybe I'm just weird, but it seems like an odd way to go about things. Now that I know who this guy is (he didn't even give me the company name he was with) I'll call him up to get the scoop. Looks like a job offer, but we'll see if his professionalism is better the second go around.
