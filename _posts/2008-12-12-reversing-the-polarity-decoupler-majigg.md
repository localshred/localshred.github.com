Okay, I am seriously crying over here this is so good. This morning I came across a post from [Dvorak Uncensored](http://www.dvorak.org/blog/ "Dvorak Uncensored") that I am still laughing hysterically over: **10 things I hate about Star Trek**. Dvorak actually just posted a link to a [forum post](http://www.bitchslapp.com/viewtopic.php?t=285 ""10 things I hate about Star Trek""), which is where the original list is at.

I must confess, I am (or used to be) a hard core Trekkie. Admittedly I haven't watched the show in years... but I cannot rescind my past Trek obsession and the awkward sense of pride I have in it. Not that it matters much, but I was definitely of the [TNG generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation "The Next Generation"), don't get much enjoyment over [TOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series "The Original Series").

Here are a few of the questions that had me rolling:

> 1. Seatbelts. Yeah, I know this one is overdone, but you'd think that the first time an explosion caused the guy at the nav station to fly over the captain's head with a good 8 feet of clearance, someone would say, "You know, we might think of inventing some futuristic restraining device to prevent that from happening." So of course, they did make something like that for the second Enterprise (the first one blew up due to poor lubrication), but what was it? A hard plastic thing that's locked over your thighs. Oh, I'll bet THAT feels good in the corners. "Hey look! The leg-bars worked as advertised! There goes Kirk's torso!"

> 2. A Star Trek quiz: Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and â€˜Ensign Gomez' beam down to a planet. Which one isn't coming back?

Okay, so a lot of people may not find those funny, but there is no question in my mind that any respectable Trekkie's (current or otherwise) are just dying at those reasons. In case you missed the link, here is [the original forum post](http://www.bitchslapp.com/viewtopic.php?t=285 "10 things I hate about Star Trek").
